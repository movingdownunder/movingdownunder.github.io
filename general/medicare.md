## Medicare (universal healthcare - if applicable)

If your home country has the reciprocal health care arrangement you can apply for Medicare, our publicly funded universal health care system in Australia.
If you have arrived on a permanent residency visa you may also apply for Medicare. Information on the application process can be found [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/medicare-card/enrol/how-enrol-or-re-enrol){:target="\_blank"}

If you earn $90,000 (singles) or$180,000 (families), for every year after 30 years of age, you will attract an increasing Medicare levy surcharge and this will be deducted from your salary.
