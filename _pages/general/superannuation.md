# Superannuation

Superannuation is a way to save for your retirement. The money comes from compulsory contributions made into your super fund by your employer. Generally, 9.5% of your salary goes into a super fund and this will gradually
increase to 12% in coming years.

There are multiple superannuation funds available, and it is best to do your own research on this. We suggest having a
look at this [comparison website](https://www.canstar.com.au/superannuation/) to aid you in your research.
